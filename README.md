# codequiz

## User Story

```
This is a coding quiz I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The quiz has a one-minute timer and displays total number of correct answers after the user hits the submit quiz button. The user is able to review all questions at the end of the quiz using previous and next buttons to see correct answers in green and incorrect answers in red. I was not able to get the user initials input and high scores code to execute correctly. 

```
